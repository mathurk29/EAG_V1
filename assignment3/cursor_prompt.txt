create a Chrome Agentic AI Plugin to Track the price of a Stock


To do this - we will use Gemini 2.0 Flash but without it's agentic capabilities.


Your task is :

create a Python tool - that can track the price of stock.

call The LLM - but strip down it's agentic capabilities using prompt engineering.

to achieve this assignment you must:
call your LLM multiple times:
Query→LLM Response→Tool Call:Tool Result→Query→LLM Response→Tool Call:Tool Result→Query→LLM Response→Result
Each time your Query stores "ALL" past interaction
Query1→LLM Response→Tool Call:Tool Result→Query2→LLM Response→Tool Call:Tool Result→Query3→LLM Response→Result


Remeber - you have to strip down the LLM from it's agentic capabilities and use them just as LLM and the LLM then has to tell how to call the tool.
